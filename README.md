## About this repository

This contains yet another "ToDo" app written on react ⚛.
It has the following pros:

- uses context API
- uses hooks
- saves the data to the local storage
- data is not retrieved/saved via the `props`, but using `useState`

### Dependencies

* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - a handy package for faster web development.
